A fatgraph is specified by listing all the vertices, followed by all the edges.
Lines starting with # at the beginning of the file are ignored
The listing is of the form:



vertices [number]
label (label must begin with alpha, and it can't be "bezier" or "loc") [number of edges]
edge names separated by spaces (these are cyclically in order)
0,1 indicating whether the edge starts here
[bezier <optional bezier coordinates (MUST AGREE WITH THE CYCLIC ORDER)> ]
[loc <optional coordinate for this vertex>]

label (label must begin with alpha) [number of edges]
edge names separated by spaces (these are cyclically in order)
0,1 indicating whether the edge starts here
[bezier <optional bezier coordinates (MUST AGREE WITH THE CYCLIC ORDER)> ]
[loc <optional coordinate for this vertex>]

edges [number]
edge_name forward_label backward_label initial_vertex final_vertex



# the vertices all have to have labels because otherwise there's no way to 
# give a vertex with no edges
