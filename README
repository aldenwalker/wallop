Wallop is a Gtk+2.0 application to display fatgraphs, especially the output of
the program scallop.

Scallop (by Danny Calegari and Alden Walker), which uses glpk, gmp, and exlp,
is provided as part of wallop in the subdirectory ./scallop/

Installation:
type "make"

You must have Gtk+2.0, gmp, glpk, pkg-config, and probably some other stuff.
It compiles on Linux with the above packages with everything standard.

Loading and saving:
Type the location of a fatgraph file and click load to load.  Click save to save.
There is no overwrite protection, etc, whatsoever.  Click save eps to write 
an eps file.  It also writes pinlabels for inclusion in latex.  The eps 
output contains text labels.  To remove them, change the line 
indicated in the eps file.  Note there's no overwrite protection on saving 
eps files, either, so it'll happily overwrite your .fg file with an eps file.


For OSX:
It is possible you will have to do nothing and everything will work.
Depending on your installation, you may need to include the argument
-arch i386
or 
-arch x86_64
in all of the compile lines to force it to compile to a particular architecture.   
This can occur if fink is installed in 32-bit mode on a 64-bit processor.


Known bugs:
 - Optimizing the whole graph with a graph with a single vertex sometimes causes
the graph to disappear (to move out of the viewable area) (sometimes)
 - Graphs with self-loops tend not to adjust their edges quite as well.
 - The buttons don't appear to depress (though they do work)
