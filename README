Wallop is a Gtk+ 2.0 application to display fatgraphs, especially the output of
the program scallop.

Scallop (by Danny Calegari and Alden Walker), which uses glpk, gmp, and exlp,
is provided as part of wallop in the subdirectory ./scallop/

Installation:
run ./makeall.sh
This just runs "make" in the current directory and in the scallop directory

You must have Gtk+2.0, gmp, glpk, pkg-config, and probably some other stuff.
It compiles on Linux with the above packages with everything standard.

For OSX:
It is possible you will have to do nothing and everything will work.  If not:

If fink is used to install the above packages, you should only need to 
uncomment the OSXINCLUDE and OSXLIB lines in the makefiles:
./Makefile
./scallop/makefile
./scallop/exlp-package/makefile
Depending on your installation, you may need to include the argument
-arch i386
or 
-arch x86_64
in all of the compile lines to force it to compile to a particular architecture.   
This can occur if fink is installed in 32-bit mode on a 64-bit processor.


Known bugs:
 - Optimizing the whole graph with a graph with a single vertex sometimes causes
the graph to disappear (to move out of the viewable area) (sometimes)
 - Graphs with self-loops tend not to adjust their edges quite as well.
 - The buttons don't appear to depress (though they do work)
