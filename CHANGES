Version 0.8 - May 4, 2011 by Alden
  - implemented saving better graph to eps with pinlabel file

Version 0.7 - January 14, 2011 by Alden
  - implemented saving simple graph to eps file

Version 0.6 - January 3, 2011 by Alden
  - fixed segfault on file-not-found for loading and saving
  - included OSX compilation in readme and makefiles

Version 0.5 - December 6, 2010 by Alden
  - edges are smooth for 2-valent vertices
  - labels try not to overlap with edges
  - calculates scl inequality
  - simplified graph picture when dragging vertices

TO DO:
  - Optimizing the whole graph sucks at positioning the vertices
  - Move multiple vertices at once?
  - with larger graphs, optimization isn't really done when it thinks it is
    (hitting "smooth arcs" multiple times is needed)
